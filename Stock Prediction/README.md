## Introduction
Stock market prediction is a crucial aspect of financial markets. This project utilizes historical stock market data to build predictive models that can forecast future trends. The data is sourced from Quandl, a platform that provides financial, economic, and alternative datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Quandl
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction.git
    cd stock-market-prediction
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Obtain your Quandl API key from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/).
2. Create a file named `config.py` in the project root directory and add your API key:
    ```python
    API_KEY = 'your_quandl_api_key'
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Stock_Market_Prediction.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and run the prediction models.
