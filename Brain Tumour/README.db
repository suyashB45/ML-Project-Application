Introduction
Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early detection for effective treatment. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual interpretation of MRI scans by radiologists. This project leverages deep learning, specifically CNNs, to build an automated system that can classify MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of MRI images of brain scans, categorized into two classes:

Tumor
No Tumor
Dataset Source
The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle or any other public dataset repository that provides labeled brain MRI images.
Data Preprocessing
Images are resized to a standard input size for the CNN.
Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the training process.
Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed with the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extracts features from the input images.
Max-Pooling Layers: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
Fully Connected Layers: Maps the extracted features to the final output.
Output Layer: Uses a softmax activation function for classification into tumor or non-tumor categories.
Hyperparameters
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 25
