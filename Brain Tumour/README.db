## Introduction
Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early detection for effective treatment. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual interpretation of MRI scans by radiologists. This project leverages deep learning, specifically CNNs, to build an automated system that can classify MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of MRI images of brain scans, categorized into two classes: 
- **Tumor** 
- **No Tumor**

### Dataset Source
- The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or any other public dataset repository that provides labeled brain MRI images.

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are resized to a standard input size for the CNN.
- Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the training process.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is designed with the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracts features from the input images.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:** Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Maps the extracted features to the final output.
- **Output Layer:** Uses a softmax activation function for classification into tumor or non-tumor categories.

### Hyperparameters
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 25

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection-cnn.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd brain-tumor-detection-cnn
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by placing MRI images in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model using the test dataset:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset.
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided in the `results/` directory.
